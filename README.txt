Travel agency Site developed with React.Js and React-Router to create an MVC architecture.

Relevent pages has relevent controllers, every model who need to parse data has parsing funcion in it, and React-router to serve specific code per route.


To run the App-client open CMD in the TA-Clinet folder, then in the consoule write NPM Install let the console finish its job then type npm start.
To run the App-server open CMD in the TA-Serverfolder, then in the consoule write NPM Install let the console finish its job then type npm start.
Both apps needs to run together.
